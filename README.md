This project uses **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with **Promises** to handle authentication logic.

## 📖 Description  

This authentication system simulates a user login process. Users enter their **username** and **password**, and the application verifies the credentials using **JavaScript Promises**. If the login is successful, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an error message appears.  

The app features a **responsive UI** and provides **real-time feedback** without page reloads.
